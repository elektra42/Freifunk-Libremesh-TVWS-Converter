Subfolders and files herein contain the hardware documentation and µC
software tools for the Freifunk/Libremesh WiFi to TV-Whitespace frequency
converter prototype for up and downshifting WiFi TX and RX for single stream
or 2T2R radios.

The CAD program used to make the schematic and pcb design is Design Spark,
available here:

You can get Designspark licenses for free, but the program itself is not
open source.  It requires e-mail registration.

Note: Some component values are preliminary and may depend on the frequency
band you intend to use.

Legal operation of the device in your country probably requires a license.
